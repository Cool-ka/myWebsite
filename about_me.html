                    <h2>Early in the morning…</h2>
                    <p>…Joanna gets up and begins her day with a cup of nice Rooibos tea. Then she loads her current project and writes code, solves issues and fixes bugs. One sip of tea – one bug down! Sometimes she wonders if Rooibos preparation can be automated with a proper script…</p>

                <div class='notall section' data-bottom-top="opacity:0; transform[swing]:scale(0.5)" data-center-center="opacity:1; transform[swing]:scale(1)">
                    <h2>Wrapping up the code in art</h2>
                    <p>Joanna’s work involves making graphic assets. She has her graphic processing software always running, so she can quickly prepare UX elements, add another set of ears on a friend’s picture, prepare mockups, icons, etc. Joanna seeks inspiration in various websites and projects, surrounding world, and the scent of her dirty chai latte.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Through the lens of a developer</h2>
                    <p>Stock photography can be useful, but the world can’t function with the same pictures of people laughing at their salads. Joanna knows that and incorporates her own photos in the projects she works on. Her eyes detect ideal lighting, best frames, mint tea and bright colors. This might explain why people greet her with “Why are you taking a picture of me?” instead of “Hello”.</p>

                <div class='customer section' data-bottom-top="opacity:0; transform[swing]:scale(0.5)" data-center-center="opacity:1; transform[swing]:scale(1)">
                    <h2>Is the customer always right?</h2>
                    <p>Perhaps not, especially when he prints out a GIF and expects it to move. But that’s ok - with a background in account management, Joanna sees world through eyes of web users and clients. Even if the customer doesn’t know what he wants, Joanna is there to assist. Sometimes with a little bit of chamomile tea.</p>
